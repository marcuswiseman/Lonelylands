// SPACING UNITS
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/*
Here we define spacing variants. These are used to generate spacing
variants for many object and utility classes to give you an easy way of
spacing out content. Typically, if a component requires more precise
spacing, this CSS should be defined in the component CSS, not here.

We don't use variables featuring xs, sm, md, lg etc as to not confuse with
responsive breakpoints.

NOTE: Be careful not to create too many as that will significantly bloat CSS.
Only create if you plan to use very often.
